                                A business entity which was established in 1989 in the field of Chakki Atta. The journey has taken meaningful turns and we have a state of art mill which has an annual production of 15000 Tons. Nature of the business has directed us to install fully automatic machines backed up by our skilled manpower has given us a massive reach and glowing reputation in Indian Market.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-4">
                                We have established an excellent reputation with our Raw Material suppliers mainly coming from Punjab and Madhya Pradesh which is well known around the globe for the finest quality of wheat.

                            <p class="mt-4">
                                Quality is the essence of our production which we have always taken pride in. BUHLER Technology, Flourtech and Bansal Engineering are few major implications which is taking our manufacturing to respectable levels of excellence. Our Plant has 16 Chakki from CHOYOL which allows the Grinding process to give Aroma to the ATTA. Our expert manpower doesnâ€™t stop here and the ATTA goes through the Cooling process through ENTOLETER which helps to prevent any insect growth. We use HIGH MAGNETS to insure there is no iron particle left in the product. As quality is the only domain that we deal in we have a modern and well equipped lab in our Mill. It facilitates us to have a quick access to the moisture levels and Ash content. Our Chakki Atta has been a market leader and spreading its arms all over India.
